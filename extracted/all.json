      "text": " PART II MATERNITY LEAVE  Entitlement to ordinary maternity leave and to additional maternity leave  4   1  An employee is entitled to ordinary maternity leave and to additional maternity leave provided that she satisfies the following conditions—  a   no later than the end of the fifteenth week before her expected week of childbirth , or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable, she notifies her employer of—  i  her pregnancy;  ii  the expected week of childbirth, and  iii  the date on which she intends her ordinary maternity leave period to start, and  b  if requested to do so by her employer, she produces for his inspection a certificate from—  i  a registered medical practitioner, or  ii  a registered midwife, stating the expected week of childbirth.   1A   An employee who has notified her employer under paragraph (1)(a)(iii) of the date on which she intends her ordinary maternity leave period to start may subsequently vary that date, provided that she notifies her employer of the variation at least—   a   28 days before the date varied, or   b   28 days before the new date,  whichever is the earlier, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable.  2   Notification under paragraph (1)(a)(iii) or (1A) —  a  shall be given in writing, if the employer so requests, and  b  shall not specify a date earlier than the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected week of childbirth.  3  Where, by virtue of regulation 6(1)(b), an employee’s ordinary maternity leave period commences with the day which follows the first day after the beginning of the fourth week before the expected week of childbirth on which she is absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy—  a  paragraph (1) does not require her to notify her employer of the date specified in that paragraph, but  b  (whether or not she has notified him of that date) she is not entitled to ordinary maternity leave or to additional maternity leave unless she notifies him as soon as is reasonably practicable that she is absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy and of the date on which her absence on that account began .  4  Where, by virtue of regulation 6(2), an employee’s ordinary maternity leave period commences on the day which follows the day on which childbirth occurs—  a  paragraph (1) does not require her to notify her employer of the date specified in that paragraph, but  b  (whether or not she has notified him of that date) she is not entitled to ordinary maternity leave or to additional maternity leave unless she notifies him as soon as is reasonably practicable after the birth that she has given birth and of the date on which the birth occurred .  5  The notification provided for in paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(b) shall be given in writing, if the employer so requests.  Entitlement to additional maternity leave   5  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Commencement of maternity leave periods  6   1  Subject to paragraph (2), an employee’s ordinary maternity leave period commences with the earlier of—  a  the date which ... she notifies to her employer , in accordance with regulation 4, as the date on which she intends her ordinary maternity leave period to start, or, if by virtue of the provision for variation in that regulation she has notified more than one such date, the last date she notifies, and  b   the day which follows the first day after the beginning of the fourth week before the expected week of childbirth on which she is absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy.  2  Where the employee’s ordinary maternity leave period has not commenced by virtue of paragraph (1) when childbirth occurs, her ordinary maternity leave period commences on the day which follows the day on which childbirth occurs.  3  An employee’s additional maternity leave period commences on the day after the last day of her ordinary maternity leave period.  Duration of maternity leave periods  7   1  Subject to paragraphs (2) and (5), an employee’s ordinary maternity leave period continues for the period of 26 weeks from its commencement, or until the end of the compulsory maternity leave period provided for in regulation 8 if later.  2  Subject to paragraph (5), where any requirement imposed by or under any relevant statutory provision prohibits the employee from working for any period after the end of the period determined under paragraph (1) by reason of her having recently given birth, her ordinary maternity leave period continues until the end of that later period.  3  In paragraph (2), “relevant statutory provision\" means a provision of—  a  an enactment, or  b  an instrument under an enactment, other than a provision for the time being specified in an order under section 66(2) of the 1996 Act.  4  Subject to paragraph (5), where an employee is entitled to additional maternity leave her additional maternity leave period continues until the end of the period of 26 weeks from the day on which it commenced .  5  Where the employee is dismissed after the commencement of an ordinary or additional maternity leave period but before the time when (apart from this paragraph) that period would end, the period ends at the time of the dismissal.   6   An employer who is notified under any provision of regulation 4 of the date on which, by virtue of any provision of regulation 6, an employee’s ordinary maternity leave period will commence or has commenced shall notify the employee of the date on which  her additional maternity leave period shall end —   a  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   b  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7   The notification provided for in paragraph (6) shall be given to the employee—   a   where the employer is notified under regulation 4(1)(a)(iii), (3)(b) or (4)(b), within 28 days of the date on which he received the notification;   b   where the employer is notified under regulation 4(1A), within 28 days of the date on which the employee’s ordinary maternity leave period commenced.  Compulsory maternity leave  8  The prohibition in section 72 of the 1996 Act, against permitting an employee who satisfies prescribed conditions to work during a particular period (referred to as a “compulsory maternity leave period\"), applies—  a  in relation to an employee who is entitled to ordinary maternity leave, and  b  in respect of the period of two weeks which commences with the day on which childbirth occurs.   Application of terms and conditions during ordinary maternity leave  and additional maternity leave   9    1   An employee who takes ordinary maternity leave  or additional maternity leave —   a   is entitled, during the period of leave, to the benefit of all of the terms and conditions of employment which would have applied if she had not been absent, and   b   is bound, during that period, by any obligations arising under those terms and conditions, subject only to  the exceptions in sections 71(4)(b) and 73(4)(b) of the 1996 Act.   2   In paragraph (1)(a), “terms and conditions” has the meaning given by  sections 71(5) and 73(5) of the 1996 Act, and accordingly does not include terms and conditions about remuneration.   3   For the purposes of  sections 71 and 73 of the 1996 Act, only sums payable to an employee by way of wages or salary are to be treated as remuneration.   4   In the case of accrual of rights under an employment-related benefit scheme within the meaning given by Schedule 5 to the Social Security Act 1989, nothing in paragraph (1)(a) concerning the treatment of additional maternity leave shall be taken to impose a requirement which exceeds the requirements of paragraph 5 of that Schedule.  Redundancy : pregnancy and maternity leave  10    1   This regulation applies where it is not practicable by reason of redundancy for an employer to continue to employ an employee under her existing contract of employment during—   a   the protected period of pregnancy;   b   the statutory maternity leave period; or   c   the additional protected period.   1A   For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) the protected period of pregnancy—   a   begins, subject to paragraph (c), when the employer is informed of the pregnancy which may be after the end of the pregnancy,   b   ends—   i   if the employee has the right to statutory maternity leave, on the day on which the statutory maternity leave period commences, or   ii   if the employee does not have the right to statutory maternity leave, at the end of the period of two weeks beginning with the end of the pregnancy, but,   c   does not begin if the employer is informed of the pregnancy on or after the day on which, had the employer been informed of the pregnancy earlier, the protected period of pregnancy would have ended in accordance with either paragraph (b)(i) or (ii).   1B   For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) the additional protected period—   a   begins with the day after the last day of the employee’s statutory maternity leave period;   b   continues during any period of continuous employment that includes the statutory maternity leave period referred to in sub-paragraph (a); and   c   ends immediately before the relevant day.   1C   For the purposes of paragraph (1B)(c) the relevant day—   a   where paragraph (1D) does not apply, is the day after a period of 18 months beginning with the first day of the expected week of childbirth;   b   where paragraph (1D) applies, is the day after a period of 18 months beginning with the day that childbirth occurred.   1D   This paragraph applies where, before the end of the statutory maternity leave period or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter, the employer has been notified by the employee of the day that childbirth occurred.   1E   Notification under paragraph (1D) must be given in writing if the employer so requests.  2  Where there is a suitable available vacancy, the employee is entitled to be offered (before the end of her employment under her existing contract) alternative employment with her employer or his successor, or an associated employer, under a new contract of employment which complies with paragraph (3) (and takes effect immediately on the ending of her employment under the previous contract).  3  The new contract of employment must be such that—  a  the work to be done under it is of a kind which is both suitable in relation to the employee and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances, and  b  its provisions as to the capacity and place in which she is to be employed, and as to the other terms and conditions of her employment, are not substantially less favourable to her than if she had continued to be employed under the previous contract.  Requirement to notify intention to return during a maternity leave period   11    1   An employee who intends to return to work earlier than the end of her additional maternity leave period, shall give to her employer not less than 8 weeks' notice of the date on which she intends to return.  2  If an employee attempts to return to work earlier than the end of her additional maternity leave period without complying with paragraph (1), her employer is entitled to postpone her return to a date such as will secure, subject to paragraph (3), that he has 8 weeks' notice of her return.   2A   An employee who complies with her obligations in paragraph (1) or whose employer has postponed her return in the circumstances described in paragraph (2), and who then decides to return to work—   a   earlier than the original return date, must give her employer not less than 8 weeks' notice of the date on which she now intends to return;   b   later than the original return date, must give her employer not less than 8 weeks' notice ending with the original return date.   2B   In paragraph (2A) the “original return date” means the date which the employee notified to her employer as the date of her return to work under paragraph (1), or the date to which her return was postponed by her employer under paragraph (2).  3  An employer is not entitled under paragraph (2) to postpone an employee’s return to work to a date after the end of the relevant maternity leave period.  4  If an employee whose return to work has been postponed under paragraph (2) has been notified that she is not to return to work before the date to which her return was postponed, the employer is under no contractual obligation to pay her remuneration until the date to which her return was postponed if she returns to work before that date.   5   This regulation does not apply in a case where the employer did not notify the employee in accordance with regulation 7(6) and (7) of the date on which  her additional maternity leave period would end.  Requirement to notify intention to return after additional maternity leave   12  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   Work during maternity leave period   12A    1   Subject to paragraph (5), an employee may carry out up to 10 days' work for her employer during her statutory maternity leave period without bringing her maternity leave to an end.   2   For the purposes of this regulation, any work carried out on any day shall constitute a day’s work.   3   Subject to paragraph (4), for the purposes of this regulation, work means any work done under the contract of employment and may include training or any activity undertaken for the purposes of keeping in touch with the workplace.   4   Reasonable contact from time to time between an employee and her employer which either party is entitled to make during a maternity leave period (for example to discuss an employee’s return to work) shall not bring that period to an end.   5   Paragraph (1) shall not apply in relation to any work carried out by the employee at any time from childbirth to the end of the period of two weeks which commences with the day on which childbirth occurs.   6   This regulation does not confer any right on an employer to require that any work be carried out during the statutory maternity leave period, nor any right on an employee to work during the statutory maternity leave period.   7   Any days' work carried out under this regulation shall not have the effect of extending the total duration of the statutory maternity leave period.",

      "text": " PART III PARENTAL LEAVE  Entitlement to parental leave  13   1  An employee who—  a  has been continuously employed for a period of not less than a year or is to be treated as having been so employed by virtue of paragraph (1A) ; and  b  has, or expects to have, responsibility for a child, is entitled, in accordance with these Regulations, to be absent from work on parental leave for the purpose of caring for that child.   1A  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  2  An employee has responsibility for a child, for the purposes of paragraph (1), if—  a  he has parental responsibility or, in Scotland, parental responsibilities for the child; or  b  he has been registered as the child’s father under any provision of section 10(1) or 10A(1) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 or of section 18(1) or (2) of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965 .   3  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Extent of entitlement  14    1   An employee is entitled to eighteen weeks’ leave in respect of any individual child.   1A  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  2  Where the period for which an employee is normally required, under his contract of employment, to work in the course of a week does not vary, a week’s leave for the employee is a period of absence from work which is equal in duration to the period for which he is normally required to work.  3  Where the period for which an employee is normally required, under his contract of employment, to work in the course of a week varies from week to week or over a longer period, or where he is normally required under his contract to work in some weeks but not in others, a week’s leave for the employee is a period of absence from work which is equal in duration to the period calculated by dividing the total of the periods for which he is normally required to work in a year by 52.  4  Where an employee takes leave in periods shorter than the period which constitutes, for him, a week’s leave under whichever of paragraphs (2) and (3) is applicable in his case, he completes a week’s leave when the aggregate of the periods of leave he has taken equals the period constituting a week’s leave for him under the applicable paragraph.  When parental leave may be taken   15   An employee may not exercise any entitlement to parental leave in respect of a child after the date of the child’s 18th birthday.  Default provisions in respect of parental leave  16  The provisions set out in Schedule 2 apply in relation to parental leave in the case of an employee whose contract of employment does not include a provision which—  a  confers an entitlement to absence from work for the purpose of caring for a child, and  b  incorporates or operates by reference to all or part of a collective agreement or workforce agreement.   Review   16A    1   The Secretary of State must from time to time—   a   carry out a review of regulations 13 to 16 and Schedule 2,   b   set out the conclusions of the review in a report, and   c   publish the report.   2   In carrying out the review the Secretary of State must, so far as is reasonable, have regard to how Council Directive 2010/18/  EU of 8 March 2010 implementing the revised framework agreement on parental leave (which is implemented by means of regulations 13 to 16 and Schedule 2) is implemented in other member States.   3   The report must in particular—   a   set out the objectives intended to be achieved by the regulatory system established by those regulations,   b   assess the extent to which those objectives are achieved, and   c   assess whether those objectives remain appropriate and, if so, the extent to which they could be achieved with a system that imposes less regulation.   4   The first report under this regulation must be published before the end of the period of five years beginning with the day on which this regulation comes into force.   5   Reports under this regulation are afterwards to be published at intervals not exceeding five years.",

      "text": " PART IV PROVISIONS APPLICABLE IN RELATION TO MORE THAN ONE KIND OF ABSENCE  Application of terms and conditions during periods of leave  17  An employee who takes ... parental leave—  a  is entitled, during the period of leave, to the benefit of her employer’s implied obligation to her of trust and confidence and any terms and conditions of her employment relating to—  i  notice of the termination of the employment contract by her employer;  ii  compensation in the event of redundancy, or  iii  disciplinary or grievance procedures;  b  is bound, during that period, by her implied obligation to her employer of good faith and any terms and conditions of her employment relating to—  i  notice of the termination of the employment contract by her;  ii  the disclosure of confidential information;  iii  the acceptance of gifts or other benefits, or  iv  the employee’s participation in any other business.   Right to return after maternity or parental leave   18    1   An employee who returns to work after a period of ordinary maternity leave, or a period of parental leave of four weeks or less, which was—   a   an isolated period of leave, or    b    the last of two or more consecutive periods of statutory leave which did not include—    i    any period of parental leave of more than four weeks; or    ii    any period of statutory leave which when added to any other period of statutory leave (excluding parental leave) taken in relation to the same child means that the total amount of statutory leave taken in relation to that child totals more than 26 weeks,  is entitled to return to the job in which she was employed before her absence.   2   An employee who returns to work after—   a   a period of additional maternity leave, or a period of parental leave of more than four weeks, whether or not preceded by another period of statutory leave, or   b   a period of ordinary maternity leave, or a period of parental leave of four weeks or less, not falling within the description in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) above,  is entitled to return from leave to the job in which she was employed before her absence or, if it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit her to return to that job, to another job which is both suitable for her and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances.   3   The reference in paragraphs (1) and (2) to the job in which an employee was employed before her absence is a reference to the job in which she was employed—   a   if her return is from an isolated period of statutory leave, immediately before that period began;   b   if her return is from consecutive periods of statutory leave, immediately before the first such period.   4   This regulation does not apply where regulation 10 applies.   Incidents of the right to return   18A    1   An employee’s right to return under regulation 18(1) or (2) is a right to return—    a    with her seniority, pension rights and similar rights as they would have been if she had not been absent, and   b   on terms and conditions not less favourable than those which would have applied if she had not been absent.    2    In the case of accrual of rights under an employment-related benefit scheme within the meaning given by Schedule 5 to the Social Security Act 1989, nothing in paragraph (1)(a) concerning the treatment of additional maternity leave shall be taken to impose a requirement which exceeds the requirements of paragraphs 5 and 6 of that Schedule.   3   The provisions  in paragraph (1) for an employee to be treated as if she had not been absent refer to her absence—   a   if her return is from an isolated period of statutory leave, since the beginning of that period;   b   if her return is from consecutive periods of statutory leave, since the beginning of the first such period.  Protection from detriment  19   1  An employee is entitled under section 47C of the 1996 Act not to be subjected to any detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by her employer done for any of the reasons specified in paragraph (2).  2  The reasons referred to in paragraph (1) are that the employee—  a  is pregnant;  b  has given birth to a child;  c  is the subject of a relevant requirement, or a relevant recommendation, as defined by section 66(2) of the 1996 Act;  d  took, sought to take or availed herself of the benefits of, ordinary maternity leave or additional maternity leave ;  e  took or sought to take—   i  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ii  parental leave, or  iii  time off under section 57A of the 1996 Act;   ee   failed to return after a period of ordinary or additional maternity leave in a case where—   i   the employer did not notify her, in accordance with regulation 7(6) and (7) or otherwise, of the date on which the period in question would end, and she reasonably believed that that period had not ended, or   ii   the employer gave her less than 28 days' notice of the date on which the period in question would end, and it was not reasonably practicable for her to return on that date;   eee   undertook, considered undertaking or refused to undertake work in accordance with regulation 12A;  f  declined to sign a workforce agreement for the purpose of these Regulations, or  g  being—  i  a representative of members of the workforce for the purposes of Schedule 1, or  ii  a candidate in an election in which any person elected will, on being elected, become such a representative, performed (or proposed to perform) any functions or activities as such a representative or candidate.  3  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), a woman avails herself of the benefits of ordinary maternity leave if, during her ordinary maternity leave period, she avails herself of the benefit of any of the terms and conditions of her employment preserved by section 71 of the 1996 Act and regulation 9 during that period.   3A   For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), a woman avails herself of the benefits of additional maternity leave if, during her additional maternity leave period, she avails herself of the benefit of any of the terms and conditions of her employment preserved by section 73 of the 1996 Act and regulation 9 during that period.  4  Paragraph (1) does not apply in a case where the detriment in question amounts to dismissal within the meaning of Part X of the 1996 Act.  5  Paragraph (2)(b) only applies where the act or failure to act takes place during the employee’s ordinary or additional maternity leave period.  6  For the purposes of paragraph (5)—  a  where an act extends over a period, the reference to the date of the act is a reference to the last day of that period, and  b  a failure to act is to be treated as done when it was decided on.  7  For the purposes of paragraph (6), in the absence of evidence establishing the contrary an employer shall be taken to decide on a failure to act—  a  when he does an act inconsistent with doing the failed act, or  b  if he has done no such inconsistent act, when the period expires within which he might reasonably have been expected to do the failed act if it were to be done.  Unfair dismissal  20   1  An employee who is dismissed is entitled under section 99 of the 1996 Act to be regarded for the purposes of Part X of that Act as unfairly dismissed if—  a  the reason or principal reason for the dismissal is of a kind specified in paragraph (3), or  b  the reason or principal reason for the dismissal is that the employee is redundant, and regulation 10 has not been complied with.  2  An employee who is dismissed shall also be regarded for the purposes of Part X of the 1996 Act as unfairly dismissed if—  a  the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for the dismissal is that the employee was redundant;  b  it is shown that the circumstances constituting the redundancy applied equally to one or more employees in the same undertaking who held positions similar to that held by the employee and who have not been dismissed by the employer, and  c  it is shown that the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for which the employee was selected for dismissal was a reason of a kind specified in paragraph (3).  3  The kinds of reason referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) are reasons connected with—  a  the pregnancy of the employee;  b  the fact that the employee has given birth to a child;  c  the application of a relevant requirement, or a relevant recommendation, as defined by section 66(2) of the 1996 Act;  d  the fact that she took, sought to take or availed herself of the benefits of, ordinary maternity leave or additional maternity leave ;  e  the fact that she took or sought to take—   i  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ii  parental leave, or  iii  time off under section 57A of the 1996 Act;   ee   the fact that she failed to return after a period of ordinary or additional maternity leave in a case where—   i   the employer did not notify her, in accordance with regulation 7(6) and (7) or otherwise, of the date on which the period in question would end, and she reasonably believed that that period had not ended, or   ii   the employer gave her less than 28 days' notice of the date on which the period in question would end, and it was not reasonably practicable for her to return on that date;   eee   the fact that she undertook, considered undertaking or refused to undertake work in accordance with regulation 12A;  f  the fact that she declined to sign a workforce agreement for the purposes of these Regulations, or  g  the fact that the employee, being—  i  a representative of members of the workforce for the purposes of Schedule 1, or  ii  a candidate in an election in which any person elected will, on being elected, become such a representative, performed (or proposed to perform) any functions or activities as such a representative or candidate.  4   Paragraph (3)(b) only applies where the dismissal ends the employee’s ordinary or additional maternity leave period.   5   Paragraphs (3) and (3A) of regulation 19 apply for the purposes of paragraph (3)(d) as they apply for the purposes of paragraph (2)(d) of that regulation.   6  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  7  Paragraph (1) does not apply in relation to an employee if—  a  it is not reasonably practicable for a reason other than redundancy for the employer (who may be the same employer or a successor of his) to permit her to return to a job which is both suitable for her and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances;  b  an associated employer offers her a job of that kind, and  c  she accepts or unreasonably refuses that offer.  8  Where on a complaint of unfair dismissal any question arises as to whether the operation of paragraph (1) is excluded by the provisions of paragraph ... (7), it is for the employer to show that the provisions in question were satisfied in relation to the complainant.  Contractual rights to maternity or parental leave  21   1  This regulation applies where an employee is entitled to—  a  ordinary maternity leave;  b  additional maternity leave, or  c  parental leave, (referred to in paragraph (2) as a “statutory right\") and also to a right which corresponds to that right and which arises under the employee’s contract of employment or otherwise.  2  In a case where this regulation applies—  a  the employee may not exercise the statutory right and the corresponding right separately but may, in taking the leave for which the two rights provide, take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular respect, the more favourable, and  b  the provisions of the 1996 Act and of these Regulations relating to the statutory right apply, subject to any modifications necessary to give effect to any more favourable contractual terms, to the exercise of the composite right described in sub-paragraph (a) as they apply to the exercise of the statutory right.  Calculation of a week’s pay  22  Where—  a  under Chapter II of part XIV of the 1996 Act, the amount of a week’s pay of an employee falls to be calculated by reference to the average rate of remuneration, or the average amount of remuneration, payable to the employee in respect of a period of twelve weeks ending on a particular date (referred to as “the calculation date\");  b  during a week in that period, the employee was absent from work on ordinary or additional maternity leave or parental leave, and  c  remuneration is payable to the employee in respect of that week under her contract of employment, but the amount payable is less than the amount that would be payable if she were working, that week shall be disregarded for the purpose of the calculation and account shall be taken of remuneration in earlier weeks so as to bring up to twelve the number of weeks of which account is taken.",

Notice to be given to employer  3  Except in a case where paragraph 4 or 5 applies, the notice required for the purpose of paragraph 1(b) is notice which—  a  specifies the dates on which the period of leave is to begin and end, and  b  is given to the employer at least 21 days before the date on which that period is to begin.  4  Where the employee is the father of the child in respect of whom the leave is to be taken, and the period of leave is to begin on the date on which the child is born, the notice required for the purpose of paragraph 1(b) is notice which—  a  specifies the expected week of childbirth and the duration of the period of leave, and  b  is given to the employer at least 21 days before the beginning of the expected week of childbirth.  5  Where the child in respect of whom the leave is to be taken is to be placed with the employee for adoption by him and the leave is to begin on the date of the placement, the notice required for the purpose of paragraph 1(b) is notice which—  a  specifies the week in which the placement is expected to occur and the duration of the period of leave, and  b  is given to the employer at least 21 days before the beginning of that week, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable.   Postponement of leave  6  An employer may postpone a period of parental leave where—  a  neither paragraph 4 nor paragraph 5 applies, and the employee has accordingly given the employer notice in accordance with paragraph 3;  b  the employer considers that the operation of his business would be unduly disrupted if the employee took leave during the period identified in his notice;  c  the employer agrees to permit the employee to take a period of leave—  i  of the same duration as the period identified in the employee’s notice, ...  ii  beginning on a date determined by the employer after consulting the employee, which is no later than six months after the commencement of that period; and   iii   ending before the date of the child’s eighteenth birthday.  d  the employer gives the employee notice in writing of the postponement which—  i  states the reason for it, and  ii  specifies the dates on which the period of leave the employer agrees to permit the employee to take will begin and end, and  e  that notice is given to the employee not more than seven days after the employee’s notice was given to the employer.   Minimum periods of leave  7  An employee may not take parental leave in a period other than the period which constitutes a week’s leave for him under regulation 14 or a multiple of that period, except in a case where the child in respect of whom leave is taken is entitled to a disability living allowance , armed forces independence payment or personal independence payment .   Maximum annual leave allowance  8  An employee may not take more than four weeks’ leave in respect of any individual child during a particular year.  9  For the purposes of paragraph 8, a year is the period of twelve months beginning—  a  except where sub-paragraph (b) applies, on the date on which the employee first became entitled to take parental leave in respect of the child in question, or  b  in a case where the employee’s entitlement has been interrupted at the end of a period of continuous employment, on the date on which the employee most recently became entitled to take parental leave in respect of that child, and each successive period of twelve months beginning on the anniversary of that date.",

Minimum periods of leave  7  An employee may not take parental leave in a period other than the period which constitutes a week’s leave for him under regulation 14 or a multiple of that period, except in a case where the child in respect of whom leave is taken is entitled to a disability living allowance , armed forces independence payment or personal independence payment .   Maximum annual leave allowance  8  An employee may not take more than four weeks’ leave in respect of any individual child during a particular year.  9  For the purposes of paragraph 8, a year is the period of twelve months beginning—  a  except where sub-paragraph (b) applies, on the date on which the employee first became entitled to take parental leave in respect of the child in question, or  b  in a case where the employee’s entitlement has been interrupted at the end of a period of continuous employment, on the date on which the employee most recently became entitled to take parental leave in respect of that child, and each successive period of twelve months beginning on the anniversary of that date.",
